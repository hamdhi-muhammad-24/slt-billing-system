"""VAT Home - Coordinates and Configuration.

All y-values are TOP-ORIGIN (y=0 at the top of the page), matching fitz's native
convention. No yt() conversion helper is needed anywhere in renderer.py - every
coordinate in this file is already in the same convention fitz draws with.

layout.pdf is a single full-page raster image (confirmed: only 2 real vector text
words on it - a corner code and "Tax Invoice"). There is no golden VAT_HOME.pdf
available in this repo to calibrate against (see CLAUDE.md mission). vat_home's
header/summary/payment-slip zone is visually near-identical to vat_enterprise's
(confirmed both ways: my own independent 300 DPI measurement of this template landed
within a few points of vat_enterprise's golden-verified numbers everywhere checked),
so those coordinates are taken directly from `templates/vat_enterprise/config.py`,
converted from its bottom-origin convention via `842.25 - y_bottom`. Only the
flow-column/content-band values are vat_home-specific (vat_enterprise has no
two-column reflow of this kind).
